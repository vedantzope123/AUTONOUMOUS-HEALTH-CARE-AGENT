# Gemini API Key Configuration
# Get your API key from: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey

# For local development, create a .env file and add your key:
VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here

# For Vercel deployment:
# 1. Go to your Vercel project settings
# 2. Navigate to Environment Variables
# 3. Add: VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY with your API key
# 4. Make sure to add it for all environments (Production, Preview, Development)

# Note: The app will work in two modes:
# 1. If environment variable is set, users can skip entering API key
# 2. If not set, users must enter their API key on the landing page
# 3. User-entered keys take priority over environment variables
